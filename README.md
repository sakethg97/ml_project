Student Test Score Prediction Model

This project involves building a predictive model to analyze and forecast student test scores using advanced machine learning techniques. The model leverages regression and ensemble methods such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting to improve prediction accuracy.

Key Features:
* Model Development: Employed advanced regression techniques to create a robust predictive model, achieving a 13% improvement in accuracy over baseline models.
* Ensemble Techniques: Incorporated Random Forest and Gradient Boosting to enhance model performance, capturing complex patterns in the student test score data.


Deployment:
* Web Application: The model was deployed as an interactive web application using Flask, allowing users to input student data and receive real-time score predictions.
* AWS Infrastructure: The deployment pipeline was managed via AWS Elastic Beanstalk for scalable hosting and AWS CodePipeline for continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), ensuring seamless updates and efficient version control through GitHub.


This project demonstrates the integration of machine learning, web development, and cloud infrastructure, delivering an end-to-end solution for predictive analytics in education.
